Gradient Mesh by Andrii Sudyn

--- HOW TO USE ---

To start using WavySprite click "GameObject > 2D Object > Gradient Mesh" in Unity's main menu.
Or do the same by right-clicking the Hierarchy panel. 
This will add a new Gradient Mesh object at the center if your current scene view.

That's it! After the object appears on the scene you can adjust its properties
in the inspector.

--- PROPERTIES ---

"Gradient" field will allow you to set the gradient colors and alpha values.

"Reverse" button will reverse the direction your gradient.

"Sector count" allows you to control level of detail for the radial gradients. 
Setting it to 4 or 6 will let you achieve diamond and hexagonal gradients.

"Sorting layer" and "Order in layer" will work exactly the same as for sprites.

--- FEATURES ---

Gradient Mesh works by proceduraly generating a Mesh with respective vertex
colors. This way you can scale the gradient to any size without loosing 
any image quality.

You can put it on a background of your acene or UI - it works with both.
